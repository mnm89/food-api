# Food API

This project is simple [Nestjs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) application to manage food via Rest API.
For the database management we use [Prisma](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/prisma)

## Description

A food can be related to a category, a food can be also related to a meal. Each model is managed by it's own crud.

## Database Models

Weâ€™ll have three models:

- Food: Represents the food items.
- Category: Represents categories (e.g., Fruits, Vegetables, etc.).
- Meal: Represents meals (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, etc.), which include multiple foods.

## Structure

- Category will be related to Food (1-to-many relationship)
- Meal will be related to multiple Food items (many-to-many relationship)

## How it Works

- Categories can be created and linked to multiple Food items.
- Meals consist of multiple Food items.
- You can query meals and retrieve all the foods linked to that meal.

```bash
$ npm install
```
