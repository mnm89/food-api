database management we use Prisma\nDescription\nA food can be related to a category, a food can be also related to a meal. Each model is managed by it's own crud.\nDatabase Models\nWe’ll have three models:\n\nFood: Represents the food items.\nCategory: Represents categories (e.g., Fruits, Vegetables, etc.).\nMeal: Represents meals (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, etc.), which include multiple foods.\n\nStructure\n\nCategory will be related to Food (1-to-many relationship)\nMeal will be related to multiple Food items (many-to-many relationship)\n\nHow it Works\n\nCategories can be created and linked to multiple Food items.\nMeals consist of multiple Food items.\nYou can query meals and retrieve all the foods linked to that meal.\n\nInstall dependencies\nExample :$ npm installCompile and run the project\nExample :\n# .env\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# database\n$ npm run db\n\n# generate models\n$ npm run generate\n\n# database migrations\n$ npm run migrations\n\n# development\n$ npm run dev\n\n# debug\n$ npm run debug\n\n# preview\n$ npm run preview\n\n# production\n$ npm run prodResources\nCheck out a few resources that may come in handy when working with NestJS:\n\nVisit the NestJS Documentation to learn more about the framework.\nFor questions and support, please visit our Discord channel.\nTo dive deeper and get more hands-on experience, check out our official video courses.\nVisualize your application graph and interact with the NestJS application in real-time using NestJS Devtools.\nNeed help with your project (part-time to full-time)?
